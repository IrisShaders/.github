        There are currently two goals of this Discord community:


        1: To provide a community space for people to chat and follow the development of Iris
        
        2: To facilitate the development of Iris.


        In accordance with the goals set, we have established the following set of rules:

- type: rules
  
  rules:
    Be decent to one another: >-
      We're all human. Any and all forms of bigotry, harassment, doxing, exclusionary, or 
      otherwise abusive behavior will not be tolerated. Excessive rudeness, impatience 
      and hostility are not welcome. Do not rage out or make personal attacks against 
      other people. Do not encourage other users to to brigade/raid other communities.

    Keep chat clean: >-
      Do not spam text, images, user mentions (pings), emoji, reactions, or anything else. 
      Do not post offensive, obscene, politically charged, or sexually explicit content. Do 
      not advertise outside of the relevant channels. Avoid using vulgar language and 
      excessive profanity. Use English at all times in public channels. A translator such as 
      https://www.deepl.com/translator is recommended if you're not familiar with English.

    Understand that support is not guaranteed: >-
      Support will be provided by the @Support Team and other users on a best-effort 
      basis. If someone cannot help you, avoid becoming angry or lashing out. Instead, 
      wait for someone else who may be able to help you.

    No links to executable files or JAR files: >-
      Uploading or directly linking to executable files is not allowed without prior 
      approval.

    Refrain from sending unsolicited pings and direct messages: >-
      Pings and DMs can be annoying to deal with, so please avoid using them unless they 
      are necessary. Use pings in replies with discretion. Do not make unsolicited support 
      requests with pings or DMs.

    Adhere to the Discord Terms of Service: >-
      We'd all like to avoid getting this community banned. No piracy! Absolutely no 
      support will be provided for people running cracked versions of the game. Providing 
      support for these people counts as a rule violation!
